- 👋 Hi, I’m @ottobrew
- 👀 My goal is to move from dabbling in code to building a career in software engineering.
- 🌱 I am currently an Applications Administrator in health care while nearing completion of a B.S. in Computer Science.  
-    I am CompTIA Project+ certified, while recently completing courses in Java, SQL, Data Structures & Algorithms, Software Engineering, Discrete Mathematics II, Information Security, and Software QA.
- 💞️ I’m looking to show some of my work so far while learning from others.
