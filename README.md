- 👋 Hi, I’m @ottobrew
- 👀 I’m interested in moving into a career in software engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently in a full-time tech support role while nearing completion of a B.S. in Computer Science.  
-    I am studying for the CompTIA Project+ exam, having recently completed courses in Java, SQL, Data Structures & Algorithms, Software Engineering, Computer Architecture, and Discrete Mathematics II.
- 💞️ I’m looking to show some of my work so far while learning from others.
