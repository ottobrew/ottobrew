- 👋 Hi, I’m @ottobrew
- 👀 My goal is to move from dabbling in code to building a career in software engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently in a full-time tech support role while nearing completion of a B.S. in Computer Science.  
-    I am now CompTIA Project+ certified, while recently completing courses in Java, SQL, Data Structures & Algorithms, Software Engineering, Discrete Mathematics II, and Information Security.
- 💞️ I’m looking to show some of my work so far while learning from others.
